/*
Package sdk contains the implementation for the Synse Plugin SDK. It
provides built-in handling for the 'Metainfo' and 'Transaction Check'
commands, which the Synse internal gRPC API specify. Additionally, it
makes defining new plugins easy by implementing all common code and
only requiring plugins to define logic that is specific to that plugin.
